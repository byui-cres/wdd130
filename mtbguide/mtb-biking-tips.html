            <p>According to National Safety Council of America <i>"Bicycling is one of the best ways to get exercise, see the sights and reduce your carbon footprint. However, bicyclists face a host of hazards. They often must share the road with vehicles, and injuries can happen even on a designated path."</i></p>
            <p>The number of deaths from bicycle incidents increased 6% in 2019 and 37% in the last 10 years, from 793 in 2010 to 1,089 in 2019, according to Injury Facts®. Of the 1,089 bicyclist deaths in 2019, 712 involved motor vehicles. <br><br>

          <h3>Simple Bike Safety Reminders for your Family</h3>
          <p>Let us not forgot that we should always start to basics. If no one follow the basic then how much more the advance ones? Below are the basic that we should consider before or while planning for a biking trip with family and friends:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Dicuss riding routes: Talk as a family about the safest routes in your neighborhood and, how to avoid potentials hazards such as driveways and sidewalks. And if you plan to go biking to the country side or mountain trails, be sure to inform the authorities so that they know you are inside the jungle or mountain trails in case accidents happens. This could save lives</li>
          <li>Never wear headphones: When riding your bike, turn off the music and do not wear headphones so you can devote your full attention to the road.</li>
          <li>Always obey traffic signs: Always ride with the traffic, obeying traffic signs and using proper hand signals. </li>
          <li>Use the right clothing with caution: Use the right clothing for biking that can protect you from heat of the sun, Use dry fit clothing that will easily dries up. Watch out for loose pant legs or shoe strings that can get stuck in bike chains. Those loose items may cause accidents.</li>
          <li>Make sure you wear bright clothing to make certain drivers can see you. If you ride at night, wear reflective cloting and use flash lights.</li>
          <li>Always wear a helmet: A proper fitting helmet should set right above eyebrows and be lightly bukcled so it doesn't slip when riding.</li>
         </ul>

          <ul>
          <li>Always check yopur equipement: 
            <ul>
              <li>Make sure your seat was properly adjusted based on your height.</li>
              <li>make certain that all parts specially the moving parts are secure and working properly.</li>
              <li>Check tires if both are inflated correctly.</li>
              <li>Bring with you some bike repair equipements, tire pump, extra tubes and patches</li>
              <li>Make sure your bike is equipped with reflector at the front and back.</li>
              <li>It is recommended to have some rear view mirros if possible and horn for warning.</li>
            </ul>

          <p>Every beginner mountain biker remembers their first time: You're on a bicycle, which makes sense. But you're riding over rocks, across streams, and over all types of different terrain, which (at least at first) feels like it makes no sense at all.</p>
          <p>It's fun and exciting, yet nerve-wracking and terrifying all at the same time. It gets easier—and more fun!—with time. But there are a few tips and tricks every one of us wishes someone had shared when we were just starting out as a beginner. Here are nine tips on mountain biking for beginners, for when you're first getting ready to shred. </p>
          <span>Credits to:<a href="https://www.bicycling.com/skills-tips/a20026941/mountain-biking-tips-for-beginners/" target="_blank">Bicycling.com</a> </span>
          
          <button class="accordion">1. Stay Loose: </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Your bike's job is to roll over technical terrain. Your job as a beginner mountain biker is to let your bike do its job. That means keeping your body loose, so it can move beneath you. Hover your butt off the saddle when riding over obstacles like roots and rocks. The more technical the terrain, the more room your bike needs to move. When ripping down a descent, think: “pushup arms” and “cowboy legs,” and flare out your elbows and knees so your body lets the bike flow rather than fighting it.</p>
          </div>
          <button  class="accordion">2. Maintain Momentum: </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>It's going to feel counterintuitive, but holding speed—and even speeding up—when the terrain gets challenging makes clearing tough sections of trail easier because your bike has the one thing it needs most to keep moving forward: momentum. Momentum is your best friend out there, maintain it whenever you can.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">3. Shift your Weight: </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>You're going to hit some extreme terrain, including steep inclines and declines. When climbing a tough pitch, shift your weight forward and lean forward to keep your center of gravity over the rear wheel to maintain traction.</p>
            <p>When the trail tilts downward, go in the opposite direction, shifting your weight behind the saddle and over the rear wheel (dropper posts are a godsend for this) to avoid going over the bars.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">4. Go Easy on Brakes:  </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>You will be tempted at some point as a beginner at mountain biking to grab both brakes and pull'em to the bars with all you've got. Resist this temptation! Mountain bike brakes are powerful enough that you need just one (maybe two) finger(s) to modulate your speed.</p> <p>Adjust your speed before the tricky stuff, like rock gardens and corners, and then maintain your speed through them. If you do find yourself going into a turn too hot, stay off the front (left) brake. Stopping your front tire will send your front tire into a slide, which is likely to send you over the bars and onto the ground. Hit the rear (right) instead; you might skid, but you're more likely to stay upright.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">5. Use All the Gears: </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Mountain bike trail profiles tend to look like Jaws opening wide for his next snack. In other words, they cover undulating terrain that shoots up and down often. Anticipate changes in terrain by shifting before you need to. It'll help you keep your momentum, which as you already know, is your best friend.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">6. Set Your Suspension: </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Most mountain bikes today have at least a front suspension fork, and most have a shock absorber in the rear as well. These are magical inventions that make big bumps nearly disappear as you roll over them. But they only work if you have them set to their active positions.</p>
            <p>As a beginner, you can take a little time learning the finer nuances of setting your sag (how much travel you use just sitting on the bike) and rebound. But take a moment to know how to lock out and/or open up your suspension, so you don't accidentally roll out onto a crazy technical trail with a fully rigid bike (it happens!).</p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">7. Look Where You Want to Go: </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Staring directly at that rock you don't want to hit will nearly ensure that you're going to smack right into it. It's called “target fixation;” your bike goes where your eyes are directing it to go. Instead, look past obstacles to where you actually want to go. Keep your chin level to the ground, eyes forward, and try to look as far down the trail as possible, using your peripheral vision to avoid and negotiate obstacles immediately in front of you. Upgrading to a trail-specific helmet will protect your head if an obstacle does trip you up.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">8. Brush Up on Basic Repairs: </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Because of the rugged nature of the terrain, mechanicals tend to happen more off road than they do on the pavement. Tubeless tire technology has helped minimize—but not eliminate—flats. So brush up on some basic repairs to be sure you can get out of the woods when something breaks. At a minimum, you should know how to fix a flat. Other good skills to have include repairing a broken chain and replacing a bent or cracked derailleur hanger. Your local shop (or a good friend) can show you how.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">9. Carry More Than a Credit Card: </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>There aren't many convenience stores in the forest or desert. Mountain bike rides will often take considerably longer than you anticipate, as you often run into rugged terrain, have a mechanical, or just get lost. Always pack more food and water than you think you need. Similarly, it's sometimes impossible for someone to come pick you up if something goes wrong. You may not have cell service even if they could. Always carry the tools you need: a spare tube (or two), pump, and multi-tool. You'll be more relaxed and have more fun with the peace of mind knowing you have everything you need. </p>
